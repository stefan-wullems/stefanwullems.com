This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) explains how to run a time-based performance analysis with Ahrefs data. It reveals how your content performs relative to its publication date and helps you identify improving or declining content over time.

**Goal**
Measure content performance relative to publication dates instead of static site-wide averages.

**Ideal Outcome**
You generate CSV outputs with performance indices, publication dates, and traffic metrics. Each page is benchmarked against content published before it, allowing you to clearly spot overperforming and underperforming content.

**Why this is Important**
Static numbers (like “50 referring domains”) don’t mean the same thing at every stage of a site’s life. A brand-new site earning 50 links might be extraordinary, while a mature site earning the same could be average. Time-based analysis shows how impressive a result was *for that moment in the site’s history*.

💡 **Competitive advantage**: Few analysts account for temporal context. Looking at *relative performance over time* means you see opportunities others miss — for example, identifying older posts that were unusually strong for their period even if their absolute numbers look modest.

**Where this is done**
**Ahrefs Site Explorer** for data exports, and the **Content Time Analysis tool** for processing and visualization.

**When this is done**
Quarterly, or after major content launches, to monitor trends and build a temporal performance database.

**Who does this**
Content Strategist or SEO Specialist.

## Prerequisites or Requirements
- **Access to Ahrefs Site Explorer**
- **Domain to analyze** (yours or a competitor’s)
- **CSV export with correct settings** (see Step 1)
- **Time to fetch published dates** (5–15 minutes depending on dataset size)


## Step 1: Upload Ahrefs Data
1. In **Ahrefs Site Explorer**, go to **Top Pages**.
2. Set date range to **“Don’t compare”**.
3. Enable **“SERP titles”**.
4. Export as **CSV with UTF-8 encoding**.
5. Include **all available rows**.

## Step 2: Configure Published Date Fetching
1. Start the date-fetching process in the tool.
2. Set **delay to 1000–2000ms** for balanced speed and politeness.
3. Expect the process to take **5–15 minutes** depending on dataset size.
4. Monitor progress in real-time.

💡 Publication dates let you calculate performance indices that normalize “how impressive” a result was at the moment it was published — not years later when expectations had changed.

## Step 3: Run Time-Based Analysis

💡 **Why median matters**: Using the *median* prevents one viral hit from distorting the benchmark. For example, a post earning 200 links on a site that normally earns 1–2 would artificially inflate the average, making other posts look weaker than they really were. The median resists these distortions.

## Step 4: Interpreting Results
- **Performance Indices**:
    - **> 1.5** = exceptional performers
    - **1.0–1.5** = solid performers
    - **0.5–1.0** = underperformers
    - **< 0.5** = poor performers
- **Historical context:** A post with 40 referring domains in 2015 might be more impressive than one with 57 in 2019, because expectations rise as a site grows.
- **Relative performance:** Indices show how surprising or impressive a result was *for that period*.
- **Sorting advantage:** Sorting by index, not absolute values, surfaces hidden gems — posts that would be overlooked if you only scanned the top-10 by links.

### Optimization Strategies
- **High performers (Index > 1.2):** Replicate and refresh these as models for future content.
- **Underperformers (Index < 0.8):** Revisit for updates or consolidation.

Time-based analysis shows not just *what* content performed, but *how impressive it was at the time*. That perspective reveals hidden winners, uncovers overlooked opportunities, and gives you a research edge competitors rarely use.
