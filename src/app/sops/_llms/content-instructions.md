## SOP Content Rules (for Interactive SOPs)

1. **Structure**
   Always follow this exact structure. Do not omit any section:

   * Intro (1‚Äì2 sentences to set the stage)
   * **Goal**
   * **Ideal Outcome**
   * **Why this is Important**
   * **Where this is done**
   * **When this is done**
   * **Who does this**
   * **Prerequisites or Requirements**
   * **SOP**: üìã Step-by-Step Instructions

2. **Tone & Style**

   * Use clear, direct, professional language.
   * Keep sentences short and actionable.
   * Avoid jargon unless absolutely necessary. If jargon is used, provide a simple explanation (e.g., explain *quartiles* or *referring domains*).
   * Write so that a beginner can follow without prior training.

3. **Section Rules**

   * **Goal**: State the main purpose in 1‚Äì2 sentences.
   * **Ideal Outcome**: Describe what success looks like in concrete, measurable terms (e.g., quartile rankings, composite scores).
   * **Why this is Important**: Link the activity to business value (e.g., efficient resource allocation, stronger SEO performance).
   * **Where this is done**: Specify the exact tool, software, or environment (e.g., ‚ÄúAhrefs Site Explorer‚Äù).
   * **When this is done**: Define the trigger or frequency (e.g., quarterly or after major content launches).
   * **Who does this**: Assign responsibility to a clear role (e.g., Content Strategist, SEO Specialist).
   * **Prerequisites or Requirements**: Use bullet points to list needed tools, accounts, files, or permissions.
   * **Step-by-Step Instructions**:

     * Use ‚ÄúStep N‚Äù as a header.
     * Begin each step with an action verb: *Open, Upload, Export, Select, Run, Interpret*.
     * Be precise about buttons, fields, or file formats (e.g., *Export as CSV with UTF-8 encoding*).
     * Cluster related instructions under a single step header if they belong together.
     * Include tips, insights, or context as callouts (üí°).

4. **Formatting**

   * Use bullet points for prerequisites.
   * Highlight file types, button names, or settings in **bold** or ‚Äúquotes.‚Äù
   * Use blockquotes for tips, warnings, or context.

5. **Completeness**

   * Each SOP must stand alone ‚Äî a new user should be able to follow it without extra explanation.
   * If another SOP is referenced, link it clearly or include its exact name.
   * Include interpretive guidance where necessary (e.g., how to read quartile rankings or composite scores).
