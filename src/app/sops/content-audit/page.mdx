# Content Audit with Ahrefs - Interactive SOP

This interactive Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a complete step-by-step process for conducting a content audit using Ahrefs data. Follow each section in order to analyze your or your competitor website's content performance.

## Overview

This workflow will help you:
- Set up a project workspace for your audit
- Export and process data from Ahrefs Site Explorer
- Enrich data with published dates for time-based analysis
- Generate content inventory analysis with composite scores
- Create time-based performance analysis to identify trends
- Export everything for further analysis

**Time required:** 5-15 minutes (depending on number of pages and configuration)

## What You'll Get

### Content Inventory Analysis
- **Composite Score**: Overall performance ranking combining traffic and link metrics
- **Quartile Rankings**: Performance quartiles for referring domains, traffic, and link quality
- **Referring Domains per Visit**: Link quality metric showing link efficiency
- **Comprehensive Scoring**: Multi-dimensional analysis for content prioritization

### Time-Based Performance Analysis
- **Time-Based Index**: Shows how each page performs relative to content published before it
- **Performance Trends**: Identify improving or declining content performance over time
- **Benchmark Insights**: Values > 1.0 indicate above-average performance for the time period
- **Strategic Planning**: Use trends to plan content updates and strategies

### Export Capabilities
- **CSV Export**: Download results for further analysis in Excel or other tools
- **Structured Data**: Clean, organized data ready for reporting and decision-making
- **Filtering Options**: Sort and filter results by various performance metrics

## Before You Begin

### Prerequisites

- Website domain to analyze
- Basic understanding of SEO metrics

### Data Export Requirements
When exporting from Ahrefs, make sure to:
1. Use **Site Explorer â†’ Top Pages**
2. Set date range to **"Don't compare"**
3. **Enable "SERP titles"** (critical for analysis)
4. Export as **CSV with UTF-8 encoding**
5. Include all available rows for comprehensive analysis

## Understanding Your Results

### Content Inventory Metrics Explained

**Composite Score**
- Combines referring domains and traffic quartiles
- Range: 2-8 (higher = better overall performance)
- Use to prioritize content optimization efforts

**Quartile Rankings (Q1-Q4)**
- Q4 = Top 25% (best performing)
- Q3 = 50th-75th percentile (above average)
- Q2 = 25th-50th percentile (below average)
- Q1 = Bottom 25% (needs attention)

**Referring Domains per Visit**
- Measures link acquisition efficiency
- Higher values indicate better link-building ROI
- Useful for identifying content that attracts quality backlinks

### Time-Based Analysis Interpretation

**Time-Based Index Values**
- **> 1.5**: Exceptional performance (significantly outperforming historical average)
- **1.0-1.5**: Good performance (above historical average)
- **0.5-1.0**: Below average performance
- **< 0.5**: Poor performance (may need significant improvement)

**Strategic Applications**
- Identify content formats or topics that consistently outperform
- Find underperforming recent content that needs optimization
- Understand seasonal or temporal performance patterns
- Plan content calendar based on performance trends

## Next Steps and Recommendations

### For High-Performing Content
1. **Amplify Success**: Identify what makes top content work and replicate those elements
2. **Internal Linking**: Use high-performing content as hub pages
3. **Update and Refresh**: Keep top content current and comprehensive
4. **Promote Further**: Increase promotion of proven performers

### For Underperforming Content
1. **Content Audit**: Review for accuracy, depth, and user value
2. **Technical SEO**: Check for crawling, indexing, or technical issues
3. **Keyword Optimization**: Ensure content targets relevant, valuable keywords
4. **User Experience**: Improve readability, structure, and engagement

### For Time-Based Insights
1. **Trend Analysis**: Look for patterns in content performance over time
2. **Content Calendar**: Plan new content based on successful historical patterns
3. **Update Cycles**: Establish regular update schedules for declining content
4. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare trends with competitor content strategies

## Tips for Success

### Data Quality
- Ensure complete data export from Ahrefs
- Include published date fetching for time-based analysis
- Use appropriate delay settings to avoid being blocked
- Verify CSV format and column headers before upload

### Analysis Strategy
- **Use Median** for sites with high backlink variance (recommended for most sites)
- **Use Average** for smaller sites with consistent link patterns
- Include published dates for comprehensive time-based analysis
- Export results immediately after analysis for backup

### Ongoing Monitoring
- Run audits quarterly to track content performance trends
- Compare results over time to measure content strategy effectiveness
- Use insights to inform content creation and optimization priorities
- Document findings and recommendations for team reference

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No valid data rows found"**
- Check CSV format and ensure it has proper headers
- Verify you exported from Ahrefs Top Pages (not other sections)
- Ensure SERP titles were enabled during export

**"Failed to find published dates"**
- Some pages may not have discoverable published dates
- This is normal and won't affect the overall analysis
- Pages without dates are excluded from time-based analysis only

**Analysis taking too long**
- Reduce published date delay for faster processing
- Consider analyzing smaller data sets initially
- Published dates are the most time-consuming part of the process

### Performance Tips
- Process smaller batches (< 1000 pages) for initial runs
- Use 500ms delay for most reliable published date fetching
- Save your project configuration for future runs
- Export results immediately after completion
