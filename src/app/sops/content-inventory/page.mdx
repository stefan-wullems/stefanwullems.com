This streamlined Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) provides a focused process for conducting content inventory analysis using Ahrefs data. Generate comprehensive performance rankings and actionable insights in minutes, not hours.

**Content inventory analysis creates a strategic roadmap for your content optimization efforts** - showing you exactly which pages deserve amplification, which need improvement, and which might be candidates for removal.

## What This Analysis Delivers

**Comprehensive Content Classification System** that transforms raw performance data into actionable insights:

**Composite Scores (2-8 Range)** - Unified performance metrics that combine traffic and backlink data into single, comparable scores. Higher scores indicate better overall performance and should guide your optimization priorities.

**Quartile Classifications** - Clear Q1-Q4 rankings that show relative performance across your entire content portfolio. Know instantly which content is in your top 25% (Q4) and which needs immediate attention (Q1).

**Referring Domains per Visit** - Unique efficiency metric that reveals which content attracts quality backlinks relative to its traffic volume. High values indicate excellent link-building ROI and content that naturally earns authority.

**Strategic Performance Insights** - Identify star performers to model, optimization candidates with potential, and underperformers that need major improvements or removal.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the content inventory analysis, ensure you have:

- **Access to Ahrefs** (Site Explorer specifically)
- **Website domain** to analyze (yours or a competitor's)
- **Ahrefs CSV export** with correct settings (see Step 1)
- **Strategic mindset** - This analysis focuses on actionable insights rather than raw data

## Step 1: Upload Your Data

Upload your Ahrefs CSV export to begin the inventory analysis. Proper export settings ensure accurate quartile calculations and meaningful insights.

### Critical Export Settings

When exporting from Ahrefs Site Explorer, these settings are **essential** for accurate analysis:

1. **Navigate to Site Explorer → Top Pages**
2. **Set date range to "Don't compare"** - Prevents parsing issues with comparison columns
3. **Enable "SERP titles"** - Critical for proper page identification in results
4. **Export as CSV with UTF-8 encoding** - Ensures all characters display correctly
5. **Include all available rows** - Larger datasets provide more reliable quartile boundaries

## Interpreting Your Content Inventory

### Understanding Composite Scores

**Score Range (2-8)** - Combines traffic and referring domain quartiles into unified performance metrics:
- **8 points** - Q4 traffic + Q4 referring domains (your absolute best performers)
- **6-7 points** - Mixed high performance (one Q4, one Q3 metric)
- **4-5 points** - Average performance (Q2-Q3 combinations)
- **2-3 points** - Below average performance (Q1-Q2 combinations)

### Composite Score Strategy

**High Scorers (6-8 Points)**
Your content portfolio's crown jewels that deserve strategic amplification:
- **Analyze success factors** - What makes these pieces perform well?
- **Create similar content** - Replicate successful formats, topics, and approaches
- **Internal linking hubs** - Use these as anchor points for site architecture
- **Maintenance priority** - Keep these pages current and optimized

**Medium Scorers (4-5 Points)**
The backbone of your content with clear optimization potential:
- **Identify improvement opportunities** - Focus on the weaker quartile metric
- **Content enhancement** - Add depth, update information, improve user experience
- **Promotion opportunities** - May need better internal linking or social amplification
- **Quick wins potential** - Often easiest to move into higher performance tiers

**Low Scorers (2-3 Points)**
Strategic decision candidates requiring careful evaluation:
- **Performance analysis** - Understand why these pages underperform
- **Consolidation opportunities** - Can multiple weak pages be combined effectively?
- **Removal candidates** - Some may be draining crawl budget without providing value
- **Major overhaul needs** - Significant improvements required for meaningful impact

### Quartile Classification Insights

**Q4 Pages (Top 25%)**
Your content success templates:
- **Study systematically** - What topics, formats, and strategies work?
- **Scale successful approaches** - Create more content following proven patterns
- **Protect and enhance** - Regular updates to maintain competitive advantage
- **Benchmark standards** - Use as quality standards for new content

**Q1 Pages (Bottom 25%)**
Priority improvement opportunities:
- **Root cause analysis** - Technical issues, thin content, or poor targeting?
- **Strategic evaluation** - Worth improving or better to remove?
- **Resource allocation** - Focus limited optimization resources effectively
- **Content audit insights** - What patterns emerge in underperforming content?

### Referring Domains per Visit Analysis

**High Efficiency Content**
Pages that earn links naturally relative to their traffic:
- **Link magnet identification** - What makes these pages naturally link-worthy?
- **Content format insights** - Which formats earn disproportionate authority?
- **Topic authority** - Subject areas where your content naturally attracts links
- **Promotion strategy** - Content worth additional outreach investment

**Low Efficiency Content**
Traffic that doesn't translate to authority:
- **Link building opportunities** - Pages that could benefit from targeted outreach
- **Content enhancement** - Make more link-worthy through improvements
- **Internal linking** - Strategic internal links to improve authority flow
- **Conversion focus** - May be better optimized for conversions than links

## Strategic Applications
