Create a content inventory interactively using Ahrefs data to classify, rank, and evaluate your website content.

**Goal**
Provide a clear process for conducting a content inventory analysis using Ahrefs data to classify, rank, and evaluate website content.

**Ideal Outcome**
You generate a complete content inventory with quartile rankings, composite scores, and efficiency metrics that highlight star performers, optimization candidates, and underperformers.

**Why this is Important**
This analysis creates a roadmap for content optimization. It helps you decide which pages to amplify, which to improve, and which to remove, ensuring resources are used effectively.

**Where this is done**
Inside **Ahrefs Site Explorer** and the Content Inventory Analysis tool.

**When this is done**
Whenever you need to assess your or your competitor‚Äôs website‚Äôs content performance, typically once per quarter or after publishing a significant batch of new content.

**Who does this**
Content strategists, SEO specialists, or marketing team members responsible for content performance.

**Prerequisites or Requirements**

* Website domain to analyze (own site or competitor)
* Access to **Ahrefs Site Explorer**
* **CSV export** from Ahrefs with correct settings

## Step 1. Export Data from Ahrefs

1. Open **Ahrefs Site Explorer**.
2. Navigate to **Top Pages**.
3. Set date range to **‚ÄúDon‚Äôt compare‚Äù** to prevent errors in the export.
4. Enable **‚ÄúSERP titles‚Äù** for proper page identification.
5. Export as **CSV with UTF-8 encoding**.
6. Select **all available rows** for the most reliable dataset.

## Step 2. Upload Data

<UploadAhrefsPageData />

## Step 3. Run Content Inventory Analysis

<ContentInventoryAnalysisStep />

> üí° **Tip**: Quartiles divide your content into four buckets (Q1‚ÄìQ4). Instead of obsessing over raw numbers, quartiles show relative performance. If a page lands in Q4, it outperforms 75% of your content. If it lands in Q1, it underperforms compared to 75% of your portfolio. This way you focus on patterns, not isolated datapoints.

## Step 4. Interpret

1. Check **2‚Äì8 point composite scores**:

   * **6‚Äì8**: High-performing content; amplify and maintain.
   * **4‚Äì5**: Mid-level performers; prioritize optimization.
   * **2‚Äì3**: Underperformers; consider overhaul, consolidation, or removal.

2. Identify **efficiency champions** with high *referring domains per visit*.
   > Example: A page with 300+ referring domains but very little traffic signals ‚Äúearned links‚Äù (people linked because of quality or originality, not just rankings).

3. Spot **low-efficiency pages** where traffic doesn‚Äôt translate into authority. These may need targeted outreach or better internal linking.

> üí° **Context**: Referring domains per visit helps separate *passive link-building* (pages rank high, so they naturally get links) from *active link-worthiness* (pages get links because they truly resonate). Especially useful when analyzing competitor sites ‚Äî it highlights which posts genuinely gained traction, not just rankings.
